7. Maximum Quality, packets and channel **???**

    You are given a list of packets of varying sizes and there are `n` channels.

    

    - Each of the `n` channel must have a single packet
    - Each packet can only be on a single channel

    

    The quality of a channel is described as the `median` of the packet sizes on that channel. The total quality is defined as sum of the quality of all channels (round to integer in case of float). Given the `packets []int32` and `channels int32` find the maximum quality.

    **Example 1:**

    

    ```
    packets := []int32{1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
    channels := 2
    
    // Explaination: If packet {1, 2, 3, 4} is sent to channel 1, the median of that channel would be 2.5.
    //               If packet {5} is sent to channel 2 its median would be 5. 
    //               Total quality would be 2.5 + 5 = 7.5 ~ 8
    answer := 8
    ```

    

    **Example 2:**

    

    ```
    packets := []int32{5, 2, 2, 1, 5, 3}
    channels := 2
    
    // Explaination: Channel 1: {2, 2, 1, 3} (median: 2)
    //               Channel 2: {5, 5}       (median: 5)
    //               Total Quality : 2 + 5 = 7
    
    // Explaination 2: Channel 1: {5, 2, 2, 1, 3} (median: 2)
    //                 Channel 2: {5}             (median: 5)
    //                 Total Quality : 2 + 5 = 7
    answer := 7
    ```
