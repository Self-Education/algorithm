# Two Pointers

### <u>Starts at different position</u>

+ #### Reverse an <u>array of string</u> or string

  To revsere **each element in an array** instead of reversing the array. Eg. `str = "word1, word2 ... wordn"`, we can reverse `str` first, then reverse each word.

+ #### In place remove Element in an Array/LinkedList

```java Â 
public int removeDuplicates(int[] nums, int k) { // duplicates are allowed to occur occur k times
         int i = 1, j = 1, count = 1;
            while(j < nums.length){
            if(nums[j] == nums[j - 1]){
                count ++;
                
            }else{
                count = 1;
            }
            
            if(count <= k) nums[i++] = nums[j]; // as long as duplicates dont occur more than k times, write to i.
            j++;
        }
        return i;
    }
