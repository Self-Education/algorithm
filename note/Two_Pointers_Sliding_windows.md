```java Â 
public int removeDuplicates(int[] nums, int k) { // duplicates are allowed to occur occur k times
         int i = 1, j = 1, count = 1;
            while(j < nums.length){
            if(nums[j] == nums[j - 1]){

            if(count <= k) nums[i++] = nums[j]; // as long as duplicates dont occur more than k times, write to i.
            j++;
        }
