## Set range of bits as 1

```java
range = ((1 << (l - 1)) - 1) ^ ((1 << (r)) - 1);
```



### check bit

+ `& 1`  will **check if origin bit is 1 or not,** `n >> index & 1` will check bit at index, `0100 >> 2 & 1` --> `0001 & 0001 = 0001 = 1`
+ `| 1` will **set bit**, `0011 | 0010 = 0010`
+ `& 0` will **set bit into 0**
+ `| 0` will **check bit.**
+ `^ 1` **flips** bit
+ **Get the first one from the right** (set bit), `x & -x` where `-x = ~x + 1`

+ **check power of 2**, number that is power of 2 only has one '1' digit, `x & (x - 1) == 0`

### Set Bit

+ **set the ith position into 1**, `num |(1 << i)`;
+ **set the ith position into 0**, first we need to make a mask that only has 0 at ith poisition. and 1 at rest of position: `~(1 << i)`, then `and` option: `num & ~ (1 << i)`
+ **set first k bits  from left side as 1 and rest as 0**:`(1 << n) - (1 << (n - k))`
+ **set first k bits from right side as 1** : `(1 << k) - 1 `

### check subsets of bits

to check the all subsets of the a bits: `subsets = (subsets - 1) & origin`

### Gray code

**definition**: is an ordering of the [binary numeral system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_numeral_system) such that two successive values <u>differ in only one [bit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bit) (binary digit).</u>

1. #### **Convert Binary number to Gray number**: 

   + keep the **Most Significant Bit** (MSB);
   + XOR each pair of adjacent bits

   ##### **<u>Example: convert A= `110111`,</u>**

   + the most left (5th from right side) bit `1` is the MSB, the **Res** = `1 _ _ _ _ _ `
   + then `A[5] ^ A[4] = 1 ^ 1 = 0`,  **Res** = `1 0 _ _ _ _ `
   + `A[4] ^ A[3] = 1 ^ 0 = 1`,  **Res** = `1 0 1 _ _ _ `
   + `A[3] ^ A[2] = 0 ^ 1 = 1`,  **Res** = `1 0 1 1 _ _ `
   + `A[2] ^ A[1] = 1 ^ 1 = 0`,  **Res** = `1 0 1 1 0 _ `
   + `A[1] ^ A[0] = 1 ^ 1 = 0`,  **Res** = `1 0 1 1 0 0`

   ##### **<u>formula</u>**

   â€‹	we noticed that `A[i] ^ A[i - 1]`, then formula is `A ^ (A >> 1)`

   ```java
   int binary2Gray(int n){
       return n ^ n >> 1;
   }
   ```

   

2. #### Convert Gray to Binary

   + keep the MSB
   + XOR the MSB with the next bit, get the new bit, lets call it `nb`
   + XOR the `nb` with the next bit, get new `nb`
   + keep doing until the end

```java
int gray2Binary(int n){
    int mask = n >> 1;
    while(mask > 0){
        n = n ^ mask;
        mask = mask >> 1;
    }
    return n;
}
```
