### Introduction

My name is Yang, so far I have 2 years of experience in building out various web applications.

Regarding my education, I have a master's degree in mechanical engineering from Washington University in St. Louis, and now enrolled in a online master program in computer science at Georgia Institute of Technology, I will graduate by the end of this year

I am currently working as a mechanical engineer at a nutraceutical company called RAAS Nutritionals, where I helped to design equipment and production process, and troubleshoot issues during the production process. I gained a great experience in working with teammate from different background, and improved my troubleshooting skills.



The passion for programming started when I firstly join the company, the company was startup and their budget was limited, but they need a ERP system to manage their inventory and files, so I proposed to them I can build a online file system for them. I spent around 6 weeks to build out a web application from the front end to the backend, and it works pretty good. I am proud of myself and gain great confidence. So I decided to move forward to make software engineer as my next career.



In order to prepare my self, I joined in a 4 months full stack web development boot camp, called Coding Dojo, and gained over 400 hours programming experience in web development. After that, I enrolled in the the online master program in computer science at Georgia Institute of Technology to further consolidate my knowledge in computer science. so far, I had build various web applications such as online inventory system, technical blog and e-commerce website.



The programming language I am familiar with are python and Java, database such as mysql and mongoDB, django and node.js as backend framework, front-end framework such as react.js.

I believe my passion for programming,  great understanding of data structures and algorithms, strong problem solving skills would make me a great asset in MSFT. Meanwhile, I am looking for an opportunity that I can to learn and improve my skills in large scale, distributed system, Azure is top cloud computing service around the world, working in a Azure team is exactly what I am looking for.
